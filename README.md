Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding

Summary

A chat bot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent. The typical customer care chat bot can answer simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions, and maybe even making appointments. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the option is typically to tell the customer the question isn’t valid or offer to speak to a real person. 
If the customer question to the helpdesk is about the operation of a device, the application shall pass the question onto Watson Discovery Service, which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owner's manual. It returns relevant sections of the owner's manual to help solve the customers’ problems. The project uses Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train it on what text in the owner's manual is important and what is not. This will improve the answers returned from the queries.
